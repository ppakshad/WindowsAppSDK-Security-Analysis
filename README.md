# WindowsAppSDK Static Security Analysis
## Security Vulnerability Report

This repository contains the **Static Security Analysis Report** for `WindowsAppSDK`. The vulnerabilities were detected using multiple static analysis tools, and the results highlight critical security issues that need to be addressed.

---

## Overview
WindowsAppSDK is a software development kit that provides modern Windows APIs. To ensure software security, a **comprehensive static security analysis** was performed to identify potential vulnerabilities in the source code.

The analysis was conducted using the following tools:
- **Cppcheck** (Code Style & Syntax Analysis)
- **Flawfinder** (Dangerous Functions Detection)
- **RATS** (Security Auditing)
- **Fluid Attacks** (Supply Chain Vulnerabilities)
- **IBM AppScan Analyzer** (Privilege Escalation & CVSS Scoring)

---

## Identified Vulnerabilities
| ID | Vulnerability Type | File | Severity |
|----|--------------------|------|----------|
| **VULN-001** | **Privilege Escalation** | `Test_WinRT_Add_Rank_B-10_A0.cpp` | ðŸ”´ High |
| **VULN-002** | **Supply Chain Attack (Lock Files)** | `packages.config` | ðŸŸ  Medium |
| **VULN-003** | **Use of Unsafe Functions (`strcpy`, `sprintf`)** | Multiple Files | ðŸ”´ High |
| **VULN-004** | **Syntax Error (`try` in global scope)** | `SecurityDescriptorHelpers.h` | ðŸŸ  Medium |
| **VULN-005** | **Missing Includes & Header Issues** | Multiple Files | ðŸŸ¡ Low |

---

## Recommendations & Fixes
To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the following actions are recommended:

1. **[Privilege Escalation]**: Implement proper access control mechanisms and validate privilege levels before execution.
2. **[Supply Chain Attack]**: Lock dependency versions and validate integrity using checksum verification.
3. **[Buffer Overflow Prevention]**: Replace unsafe functions (`strcpy`, `sprintf`) with secure alternatives like `snprintf` and `memcpy_s`.
4. **[Syntax & Header Fixes]**: Ensure all required headers are properly included and syntax issues are resolved.

## CVSS Scoring for Critical Issues
| Vulnerability | CVSS 3.1 Score | CVSS 4.0 Score | Impact |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Privilege Escalation | 8.5 (High) | 9.1 (Critical) | High Risk |
| Supply Chain Attack | 4.6 (Medium) | 5.2 (Medium) | Medium Risk |
| Buffer Overflow | 9.0 (Critical) | 9.5 (Critical) | High Risk |
